Problem #1 Solution:(Groupowners.py)

Implemented a group_by_owners function by passing files as a parameter.
Created a Result dictionary variable.
Written a logic in For loop for exchanging of key value pairs.

Problem #2 Solution  (Polindrome.py)

Used Recursive Function to check if a string is a polindrome.
Initially Case of a string has been changed (s.lower()) to ignore the case in the output.
If length of string is less than 2,then return true
Else if compare first and last elements of string if they are same.Then,substring(1,l-1) is called.
This method compares the first and the last element of the string and gives the rest of the substring to a recursive call to itself. 

Problem #3 Solution  (main_module.py)

Parsed a log file by calling basicconfig() and returned errors and warnings.
used the filemode W which eliminates writing to log file again and again while compiling.

Problem #4 Solution  (cd.py)

Created a cd function by passing new path as an argument.Created a new list of path by splitting it 
Append / with new path list.Implemented a while loop in which if pathlist is ..,then it is popped out,else append it.
Finally joined the pathlist 

Problem #5 Solution  (stu.py)

Created a constructor which contains all parameters (name,rollno,age,gender)
Implemented function to insert records(insert())
Implemented function to Search records(search())
Implemented function to delete records.(delete())
Implemented function to update records(update())

inserted records by using append()
Searched records by checking the roll no as it is unique.
deleted records by using del ls[i]
